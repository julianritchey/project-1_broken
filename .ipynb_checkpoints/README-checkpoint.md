# Investor's dream application #

### Background ###
> <p align="justify"> Starbucks is a multinational coffeehouse chain that was founded in 1971 in Seattle, Washington. The company initially sold only coffee beans and coffee-making equipment but soon started serving coffee as well. Today, Starbucks is one of the world's largest coffeehouse chains, with more than 32,000 locations in 83 countries. </p>
>  
> <p align="justify"> Starbucks is best known for its high-quality coffee, as well as its cozy, inviting atmosphere that encourages people to spend time in their stores. The company serves a wide variety of coffee beverages, as well as tea, pastries, sandwiches, and other snacks. </p>
>  
> <p align="justify"> Starbucks' competitors include other large coffee chains such as Dunkin' Donuts, Costa Coffee, Tim Hortons, and Peet's Coffee, as well as smaller, independent coffee shops. In recent years, fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also entered the coffee market, offering their own coffee and breakfast menus to compete with Starbucks.</p>

### FinTech involvement ###
> <p align="justify"> Starbucks is considered a technology leader in the food and beverage industry, with several digital initiatives that have helped the company streamline operations, improve the customer experience, and increase sales. Some of the ways that Starbucks uses technology to their advantage include:</p>
>
> 1. Mobile ordering and payment: Starbucks has a mobile app that allows customers to order and pay for their drinks ahead of time, reducing wait times and increasing convenience.  
> 2. Loyalty program: Starbucks has a rewards program that rewards customers with points for purchases made with the mobile app or physical Starbucks Card. This incentivizes customers to make repeat purchases and helps Starbucks gather data on customer preferences.  
> 3. Data analytics: Starbucks uses data analytics to understand customer behavior, including which products are most popular, when and where people are buying, and which promotions are driving sales.  
> 4. Digital partnerships: Starbucks has formed partnerships with companies like Spotify and Uber to integrate their services into the Starbucks mobile app, creating a seamless experience for customers.
> <p align="justify"> Due to its focus on digital innovation and mobile payment technology, Starbucks is often considered a FinTech company. However, it's worth noting that while Starbucks does use financial technology to improve the customer experience, it is primarily a coffee company with a strong digital presence, rather than a pure FinTech firm.

<p align="justify"> Starbucks is teaming up with Microsoft to track coffee bean production. This helps them conform to ethically sourced beans.
  
> <p align="justify"> In 2015, Starbucks announced it had reached an industry milestone of 99 percent ethically sourced coffee, consciously leaving the remaining 1 percent to allow for discovery and work in new origins. Any company can claim to source sustainably, and many do, but transparency is key to those commitments, and technology is key to transparency, Burns said.

### Strengths and weaknesses ###
<p align="justify"> Starbucks has long been active in the FinTech space, providing mobile and online features to consumers such as digital ordering, digital payments, and even digital wallets in the form of gift cards.

> Despite its strengths, Starbucks faces some challenges in the FinTech space, including:
> - Cybersecurity risks: With so much personal and financial information being transmitted through its mobile app, Starbucks faces the risk of cybersecurity breaches and other digital threats.
> - Technical issues: As with any technology platform, Starbucks' mobile app and digital systems can sometimes experience technical glitches or outages that can frustrate customers.
> - Privacy concerns: As Starbucks collects more data on customer behavior, it must be mindful of privacy concerns and ensure that it is using customer data in a responsible and transparent way

### Moving forward ###
Starbucks is aiming for 100% ethically sourced coffee beans.
> <p align="justify"> Since its beginning, Starbucks has known the names of the farmers within its supply chain, including the more than 380,000 farms it worked with last year alone. Through the foundational work in the Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E) Practices program, Starbucks has traceability today. But incorporating technology and digitizing the traceability creates the potential for more ways to share more information with both customers and farmers.
